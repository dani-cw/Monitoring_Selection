# Monitoring_Selection
Files for Monitoring Analyst selection at Cloudwalk

Thank you for the opportunity for this monitoring analyst selection!

Here is a quick guide on how the answers are organized.

Task 3.1 - answers on "Undestand the Industry.md"

Task 3.2 - answers on "Get your hands dirty.md"
  + "FilterFraudsters_d.py" in case you're intested on the sorting script made (it's transcribed on the md, so shouldn't be necessary!)

Task 3.3 - code on "antifraud.py"

Folder Data: Data provided for the case.

I hope you like my responses, and i'm eager to hear the feedback!
